Recommendations for project approach

The study case 3 has shown a trend of expanding the work force up up to 45-50 people with a long estimated project duration for 2 years, so that this project is likely to receive many changes and will possibly have new requirements. This means they will need an approach that falls under an Agile methodology rather than Waterfal methodology. Hence we recommend the software team to use Scrum approach.


Why Scrum is suitable for this project
- This case study is in long 2 years duration, its believed that the project is complicated in some areas such as scaling up the team to make the game app into reality, and manage the team’s framework of 45-50 people so many changes and challenges may happens which is unclear how to deal with at the beginning of the project.
- The project requirements aren’t 100% set in stone and are open to some change, Scrum enable the team to adapt to changing project requirements.
- Scrum provides constant check-ins and allows members to more accurately gauge progress and offer useful feedback.
- Scrum allows the team to plan for each sprint with external contribution involved. We believed its essential for this case study 3 because its a small game startup company means they has to do the work themself. Scrum also permits self-sufficient among team members. This is very important in a team that is unfamiliar with each other such as this case 3.
